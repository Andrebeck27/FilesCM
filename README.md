# FilesCM
Context menu option to upload file to Files.vc

## Installation
### Windows only! For now..

Run 'run this!.bat' in the root folder.

*If you get a warning in the Powershell terminal asking "whether you want to run this script or not", press `R` and `Enter`.*

## Usage
1. Right-click on any file \ directory and click on "Send to files.vc" \ "Compress and send to files.vc"
2. By default, the output link will be **automatically copied to your clipboard** and you will be notified once the upload is complete. This can be changed in the settings.
> [!NOTE]
> Upload will be immediately rejected if the file selected is bigger than 10 GB!
>
> If you receive an empty notification, there was an internet connection error; check if Files.vc is up and running, or if your internet connection is stable.

## Settings
Settings are stored in `C:\Program Files\FilesCM\settings.ps1`.
Open this file in any text editor.
